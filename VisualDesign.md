# Visual Design 

## Mood Boards

We have collected a collage of potential styles and aesthetic for our website. Below we have a range of different types of layout and designs.

## Typography

We have decided to use Playfair Display and Proxima Nova as our two main focus fonts. We plan to use Playfair Display for main healines and Proxima Nova on all other text on the website.

## Style

We chose to go with a traditional style to go with the tagline "Since 1973". This traditional aesthetic will show the progression over the years and how much customers appreciate our services. Showcasing the wood pictured below is to establish the traditional tones we plan to have throughout the design.

## Color Swatches

 We chose these colors because they provide a since of traditonal and up-scale values. We want our customers to leave with a suit that provides the best version of themselves.

## Logo / Brand

First pass of potential logos for the website. We are going for a simplistic design which showcases our company's mission and tagline "Since 1973".

 Second Pass of potential logos for the website. We want to incorprate more of a custom elements so we decided to incorporate  some designs with a neddle and thread for example.
