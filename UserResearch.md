# User Research

## User Champion
The User Champions of this project are ourselves (Roderick and Narges) because we are keeping the end-user in mind the entire time and not just the re-design. We want to make sure the website experience overall turns into the end user coming to the in-store location. We are constantly evaluating styles and tactics to pull those customers in such as offering more imformation with pictures than words.

## User Interviews

* Age ?
* Gender ?
* Highest Level of Education ?

* What influences your purchasing decision the most when buying a suit ?
* Where do you go first to search for a suit ?
* What devices do you use the most when shopping ?

Men's Warehouse is a chain suit shop and we visited a local one in Baton Rouge. We noticed they have pricing info on custom suits immendientaly on the window, which we really liked it. We also noticed that in their custom area they allow you to touch and experiment with different cloths, which is extremely helpful. You can even apply those cloths to a model which is pictured above and this is great for visulaizing your entire suit. Lastly, the store was organized into four main areas: business suits seperated by brand, wedding suits/tuxdeos, accessories and custom suits.

## Gather Findings

We are looking to explore how to get more on foot traffic to enter the store. As of now most customers are by word of mouth and personal relationships. Our research data shows most people want to shop locally in their area for suits, which work perfectly for what we are trying to achieve. Also, per our user research data we see more people would be interested in spending more money if there is a discount or sale involved. Therefore, we will explore more ways to attract new customers by offering some deals such a free cleaning or suit repair for first-time customers. 

## User Personas

Pre Assumptions of what users we think would be in the market for custom suits.
