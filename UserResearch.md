## Research Market Data

Men's Warehouse is a chain suit shop and we visited a local one in Baton Rouge. We noticed they have pricing info on custom suits immendientaly on the window, which we really liked it. We also noticed that in their custom area they allow you to touch and experiment with different clothes, which is extremely helpful. You can even apply those clothes to a model which is pictured below and this is great for visulaizing your entire suit.
