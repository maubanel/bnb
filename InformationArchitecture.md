# Information Architecture

## Cardsorting
 
Comparing R&N Custom Clothiers to its competitors Martinez Custom, George Bass, iTailor and Men’s Wearhouse /Jos A. Banks. We listed all visible features on each website and then ranked our most important features we would like to see.

## Navigation Hierarchy (Grouping)
Upon reviewing the cardsorting exercise we noticed an overlap of certain words. We noticed Collection (Brands), About Us, FAQ and Contact Us were used between all the sites. Collecting this data will show how we should name certain things on the Custom Clothier website. This also lead to the following exercise of Grouping, which are grouping our features we think are important for the website.

After careful investigation of the content and categories existing on the competitor's websites (men's suit and clothing). I noticed there is important information missing on the B&B website. Even though the values, goals, and target users of those businesses/websites are different from each other and the B&B website, there is certain info that needs to be on every custom suit clothiers website. This information includes: a photo gallery of previously made suits, price info, the process customers would go through for getting their suits/services, a list of the products/services they have, history/reputation of the store(about us), reviews/rates & FAQ. In the image below, I have made a page listing all the different information/categories needed to be on the R&N website. Having in mind the client's goals and values, I have demonstrated the most significant info in the way I organized them. Furthermore, the green labels are the ones that already exist on the website but other labels need to be added later. However, the way we are going to group, categorize, and organize this information might change. To make the final decision about the information architecture of this website more research about the customers (who are mostly business professionals and professional athletes) and their specific needs should be provided.

I chose to my grouping in a Venn Diagram style and group based on where products/links shall fall. I chose to make Products the big circle because that is essentially the main reasons customers are coming to the site. Inside of products I listed Jackets, Shirts, Tuxedos and Pants as supporting circles. I then made a mini circle in Jackets for Sport Coats because some customers maybe looking for specific jackets styles. The outskirts of the circle I have Pricing, Logo, Appointment, Accessories and Location/Hours. Personally, if I’m interested in the site I will go to Pricing and or Location/Hours. I have sales within pricing as a supporting circle. Within Accessories I have belts and the outside of Accessories I have shoes. Lastly, Contact Us and FAQ are outside of the Location/Hours circle. Process is within FAQ and Social Media is within Contact Us. The exercise really showed which features are important and are optional.

## Create Sitemap

We created this sitemap to show flow and organization of the website. We narrowed down our five nav bars to be: Products, Appointment, Accessories, Services and Contact Us. Those will serve as our main pages and within those will be sub pages with more detailed photos and information. We made sure to include a promotional banner and brand information because we know this is something a custom suit buyer will care about.
