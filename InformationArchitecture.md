## Grouping

After careful investigation of the content and categories existing on the competitor's websites (men's suit and clothing). I noticed there is important information missing on the B&B website. Even though the values, goals, and target users of those businesses/websites are different from each other and the B&B website, there is certain info that needs to be on the websites based on the type of business they are doing (the common element between them). This information includes: a photo gallery of previously made suits, price info, the process customers would go through for getting their suits/services, a list of the products/services they have, history/reputation of the store(about us), reviews/rates & FAQ.  In the image below, I have made a page listing all the different information/categories needed to be on the B&B. Having in mind the client's goals and values, I have made an emphasis on some of them in the way I organized them. Furthermore, the labels in green are the ones that already are on the site and other labels need to be on the website. the way we are going to categorize and organize this information might change. To make the final decision about the information architecture more research about the customers (who are mostly business professionals and professional athletes) and their specific needs.
